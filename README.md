# IT326-DataMining-Project
Project Information

 Project Description:
 This project aims to solve is predicting whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on personal and travel-related attributes.
The main objectives are: 
- Classification: Build models to classify passengers into two categories (Survived or Did not survive) based on attributes such as age, gender, passenger class, and fare.
  
- Clustering: Group passengers with similar characteristics such as social class (Pclass), family size on board (SibSp, Parch), and port of embarkation (Embarked) to discover hidden patterns related to survival behavior.

 Project Motivation:
 The sinking of the Titanic is a historically significant event, and its dataset is one of the most widely used in data mining and machine learning research. We chose the Titanic dataset because it is well-known, rich in features, and widely used in data mining research. It provides a practical way to apply classification and clustering techniques while understanding how social, demographic, and economic factors influenced survival.
